# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)



# 40.times do 
#   Student.create(first_name: Faker::Name.first_name, last_name: Faker::Name.last_name)
# end

# 7.times do
#   SchoolClass.create(title: Faker::Dessert.flavor, room_number: rand(1...500))
# end
